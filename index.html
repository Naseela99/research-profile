                    Walking into a mathematics classroom during the 
                    Summer breaks of 2014, I could feel the confused gaze
                     of the male students and professors. This was my first
                      experience of being treated differently. And this 
                      repeated during my undergraduate when I was working as a research assistant in a 
                      lab to analyze the effects of pandemic on twitter users and yet again when 
                      I walked into a classroom to present my project paper in 
                      Applications of Natural Language course during my master's. 
                      The biggest question I ask myself is, <span class="statement-text">Am I paranoid?</span> 
                      Mostly, no! But sometimes, yes. This takes me back to probably the first BBC article I read when 
                      I was trying to find a word for my feeling - 
                      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20160826-paranoid-it-could-be-the-key-to-your-success" class="bbc" target="_blank">Paranoid? It could be the key to your success</a>
                      . At a young age, I understood that your weakness in one aspect can be your
                       strength in another. My passion to understand and quantify language walked me 
                       down the path of Natural Language Processing. It started during my final year 
                       as an undergrad student where I defended my thesis on applying deep learning
                        algorithms to identify the impact of covid-19 pandemic on mental health of people 
                        using their tweets which resulted in  publication at a peer reviewed journal with me 
                        being the first author.
                </div>
                <div class="statement-para">
                    During my master's at University of Southern California, I took several courses
                     in the realm of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. But the course
                      I enjoyed the most was my course of Machine Learning which structured the course
                       around recent topics like Large Language Models, Prompt Engineering, Adversarial 
                       Machine Learning, Generative AI using variational auto-encoders. During this course,
                        I worked in a team of 4 PhD level students working on a project 
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p4Q9tm8uoTtBQ3t2nsEpKB4OOfid9RGV/view?usp=sharing" class="pro" target="_blank">Does explainable AI agree with psychologists</a>
                        where we examined if there are significant alignment between associations between 
                        lexical cues and people’s inner characteristics found by Explainable AI (XAI) 
                        and established associations in social psychology.This project received huge acclamation 
                        from the teaching staff and we received a 100 on the project. The project brought me close to the 
                        types of research problems I want to focus on. I have strong interest in studying and examining the 
                        human language to understand human behavior and social sciences. The emergence of deep learning and 
                        natural language models have expanded the horizons to understand human language more than ever. 
                        Employing these models to understand the human language, exploring these models for any kind 
                        of implicit bias and increasing the explainability of these models is where my research interest lies.

                    Currently, my research is spanned across two topics - efficent scientific document labeling and bridging the gender gap in research
                     communities. At MINERVA, I am working on labeling NASA SBIR abstracts. During the project, the team realized that the labels assigned to these documents are
                     a mix of coarse-grained and fine-grained labels. This led to an intersting sub-project of developing a unique label space for a set of documents. We therefore
                     tackled two major research problems - label space generation and label assignment. Besides this,  I am working on using social network of co-authors and citations and lexical cues of the
                      language used in research articles to factor out the reasons for female 
                      scientists having lower citations than their peers. I aim to use post ad-hoc 
                      explainability methods to understand the results of AI models and make these results
                       as transparent as possible. I also aim to increase the explainability of AI models 
                       to extract important information from the large models and identify how these
                       decisions are made.

                    Through analytics and automation, I optimized library costs and services. By creating Tableau dashboards to analyze vendor usage patterns, I identified opportunities to consolidate suppliers. This drove a 12% reduction in per-user library spend. To modernize reporting, I scripted Python tools to auto-generate critical compliance documents. This slashed associated labor costs by 55% and sped up report delivery to stakeholders by 65%. My analysis of usage patterns across student segments revealed redundancies and high-spend accounts. The data-driven insights allowed improved targeting of resources. As a result, I achieved a 12% reduction in per-user usage costs. Overall, my initiatives improved efficiency, accelerated workflows, and delivered substantial cost optimization for library services.

                <div class="description">To examine the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, I built a targeted 1 million tweet dataset by leveraging Tweepy for scalable Twitter scraping. This enabled training of a depression detection model suited to pandemic contexts. I developed a BERT classification model to detect signals of depression in tweets, achieving 87% accuracy. Compared to pre-pandemic datasets, my model showed a 25% increase in depression signals, revealing significant mental health effects of COVID-19. As first author, I drove the direction of this tweet classification research and authored critical sections of a conference paper detailing the methodology and findings. I presented this work at the 2022 International Conference on Textual Information Systems, highlighting my capabilities in leading impactful NLP projects from data collection through publication.

By architecting and building appointment scheduling capabilities, I enabled students to directly book meetings with faculty members. This decreased student wait times for faculty meetings by 25%. I also collaborated with a 3-person front-end team to overhaul the live academic portal, enhancing responsiveness and ease-of-use for our 8,000+ student user base. Through optimizing page load speeds and simplifying site navigation, we reduced load times by 30%. My full-stack development contributions upgraded critical student-facing systems to be more efficient, user-friendly, and scalable.</div>

                        Applied Lime and Shap explainable AI techniques to diverse classification models including Random Forest,
                         Logistic Regression, and SVM to assess personality traits based on the Big Five model, IRI-based empathy/distress traits,
                         and MFT-based morality traits. Identified 50% of the most influential words in the original text using Lime and Shap and 
                         then conducted a comprehensive analysis utilizing statistical evaluations to compare established LIWC features
                         between the original and transformed texts comprising those influential words. 
                         The analysis revealed a lack of statistically significant associations between therotically established groundtruths of psychology
                         community  - LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) features and the text when 
                         reduced to the influential words highlighted by Lime and Shap.
                          This provided insights into feature interpretability in text analysis within the various classification models.
                          Overall, determined through the statistical tests that the established LIWC features did not have a statistically 
                          significant relationship to the transformed text with 50% of the most influential words. This sheds light on the role 
                          of feature interpretability in text classification tasks using different models when the text is reduced to its most 
                          influential components identified by Lime and Shap.

                    Fact Verification - Can Mighty Transformers Identify Claims and Evidences?
                    </div>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <div class="project-description">
                        The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) benchmark is an important dataset used to evaluate automated fact checking systems. It contains 185,445 claims manually verified against Wikipedia pages to be labeled as Supported, Refuted, or NotEnoughInfo. My goal was to improve the performance of a fact checking model on this benchmark dataset. Through enhancements to the model architecture and text representations, I was able to boost accuracy by 4% absolute, achieving 93% fact verification accuracy.
    
    Specifically, I employed a neural network model with several key components. First, input encoding was done using HuggingFace's pretrained BERT model. BERT is a transformer model trained on large corpora to produce semantically rich text embeddings. Using BERT allowed the model to better understand the underlying meaning of the claims and evidence documents. This was an important enhancement over previous baseline methods.
    
    Second, I implemented a document retrieval module to find relevant Wikipedia pages based on the claim text. Candidate evidence documents are identified through sparse keyword matching and dense embedding similarity approaches. This retrieves possibly relevant evidence pages to verify the claim.
    
    Next, an evidence extraction module selects pertinent sentences from the retrieved Wikipedia documents to serve as evidence. By focusing on relevant evidence sentences, it reduces noise and improves the quality of evidence fed into later stages.
    
    Finally, a claim-evidence inference module predicts if the claim is Supported, Refuted, or NotEnoughInfo based on the encoded claim and extracted evidence representations. This component determines the veracity of the claim by modeling the interaction between the claim and evidence text.
    
    The model was trained end-to-end on the FEVER dataset to optimize the components to work effectively together for fact checking. The improvements from using BERT and the enhanced model architecture over previous baseline methods account for the 4% absolute accuracy gain achieved on the dataset. This demonstrates the value of leveraging strong pretrained language models and engineering a model architecture tailored for fact verification.

                    An AI agent was architected to play the 5x5 Chinese board game 
                    Little Go, achieving over 90% win rates against benchmark 
                    opponents. This was accomplished by developing a Minimax 
                    search algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning in Python to explore 
                    future game states and select optimal moves.

                    The Minimax search algorithm modeled the two-player game as 
                    adversarial search, evaluating possible future game states up 
                    to a depth of 13 moves. It assigned maximizing and minimizing 
                    scores to the AI agent's and opponent's possible moves using a
                     heuristic evaluation function. Alpha Beta Pruning was 
                     implemented to prune away branches that were guaranteed to be 
                     worse than already explored options, increasing search 
                     efficiency.

                    The heuristic evaluation function was designed through 
                    iterative testing and tuning, incorporating factors such 
                    as number of stable pieces, liberties, and territory to 
                    estimate the value of board positions. The agent's opening book 
                    and endgame databases were also optimized by analyzing patterns 
                    in winning games.

                    By effectively combining the optimized Minimax search with powerful 
                    heuristics, domain-specific adaptations, and move precomputations, 
                    the AI agent was able to successfully evaluate complex positions 
                    and make tactically strong moves. The over 90% win rate demonstrated 
                    the agent's proficiency in strategic decision-making and planning to 
                    achieve victory. The specialized techniques developed could 
                    generalize to building AI for other complex board games.

                    A hybrid recommendation system was developed to 
                    predict user ratings for restaurants by employing a 
                    weighted average approach that combined an item-based 
                    collaborative filtering recommender using Pearson 
                    correlation similarity with an XGBoost regressor model. 
                    The item-based collaborative filtering component generated 
                    recommendations based on similarity of rating patterns 
                    between different restaurants, while the XGBoost regressor
                     predicted numeric rating values. By combining these two 
                     components using a weighted average ensembling approach, 
                     the hybrid model achieved an RMSE of 0.97 on the prediction
                      task, demonstrating improved accuracy over a baseline model 
                      RMSE of 1.09. This hybrid integration of collaborative filtering 
                      and regression techniques enabled more robust and accurate rating 
                      predictions. To optimize the runtime performance of the 
                      recommendation system, PySpark RDD APIs were leveraged to 
                      distribute the data processing and model training. 
                      The Spark RDDs allowed parallelization of computations 
                      across clusters, significantly speeding up the processing 
                      time for the dataset containing 3 million rows of
                       user-restaurant ratings. The use of PySpark reduced the 
                       total runtime from approximately 7200 seconds in the
                       original configuration to just 1800 seconds after 
                       optimization, underscoring a 4x improvement in processing 
                       time. This considerable enhancement in efficiency enabled 
                       more rapid iteration during model development and 
                       facilitated application of the system to larger real-world 
                       datasets. Overall, the PySpark implementation delivered 
                       substantial gains in scalability and speed for the 
                       recommendation engine.
